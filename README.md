**By: David and Shoshan Kochav-Zeevi**

The story follows the journey of **Tzipi**, a small bird with large, curious eyes, who discovers the world and the strengths hidden within her. Through simple daily experiences, Tzipi learns important lessons about choice, friendship, and emotional resilience.

### **Key Highlights of the Story:**

1. **The Power of Choice:** Tzipi's mother teaches her to listen to her heart. Tzipi practices this by choosing to eat sweet strawberries and sing songs that make her feel pleasant, thereby strengthening her sense of independence.  
2. **Accepting Differences:** During her flight, Tzipi meets diverse friends – a jumpy sparrow, a dove that loves silence, a fast swallow, and a patient heron. She learns that there is no single right way to be a bird, and that everyone is special in their own way.  
3. **Coping with Fear:** When the sudden noise of a falling leaf startles her, Tzipi doesn't run away. She pauses, takes a deep breath, and calms herself using empowering affirmations ("I am brave"), serving as an important tool for emotional regulation.  
4. **Finding Beauty in Small Details:** Tzipi's curiosity allows her to see magic in places others might miss, such as a simple drop of water sparkling on a stone like a diamond.  
5. **Home and Security:** The story concludes with Tzipi returning to the special birdhouse built for her by Shoshan – a colorful home in shades of blue and green, decorated with sparkling stones. There, she feels safe, loved, and wise.

**Core Message:** The story encourages children to listen to their inner voice, accept others, and find security and joy both within themselves and in their immediate surroundings.
